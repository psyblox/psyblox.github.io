# Psyblox — Personal projects & experiments

This repository hosts the static website for Psyblox (https://psyblox.dev).

What I added
- index.html: Main homepage (already committed).
- styles.css: Site stylesheet.
- CNAME: Custom domain (psyblox.dev). Ensure DNS is configured to point to GitHub Pages.

How to update
- Edit HTML files directly and push to the main branch to update the site.
- Add images under an `assets/` directory and reference them from HTML.

Notes
- GitHub Pages needs to be enabled in the repository settings (branch: main, folder: /).
- If you want a simple content workflow later, consider converting to a static site generator.
